# Introduction

H2O watercoolers is a water dispenser rental and water delivery company that works in the Costa del Sol, Spain. Due to their continuous growth they are in need for an logistic solution for their daily deliveries.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to improve their daily routes by reducing delivery times, improving communications between administration and the driver, and automating their administration.

## Intended Use

This will be primarily used by the driver to complete orders and to follow-up on the next client. As a secondary user, we will have administration that will be entering the orders manually.

## Scope

We will cover the application needed for the driver as the application for administration, while also setting up the necessary communication tools to improve the logistics and business of H2O Watercoolers.
